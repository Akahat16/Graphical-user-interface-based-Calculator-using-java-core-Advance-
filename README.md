# Graphical-user-interface-based-Calculator-using-java-core-Advance-
This project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) calculator implemented in Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key Features:
User Interface: The calculator features a clean and intuitive layout created using Java Swing. It includes buttons for digits (0-9), basic operations (+, -, ร, รท), and an equals button to compute results.

Functionality: Users can input numbers and operations through the GUI. The calculator processes inputs in real-time and displays the results instantly.

Event Handling: Java's event handling mechanism is used to manage button clicks, ensuring responsive interaction and a smooth user experience.

Input Validation: The calculator includes basic validation to handle division by zero and invalid inputs, providing appropriate error messages when necessary.

Technologies Used:
Java Swing: For building the GUI components.
Java AWT: For layout management and event handling.
This GUI-based calculator serves as a foundational project for beginners to understand Java programming concepts, event handling, and GUI design.
